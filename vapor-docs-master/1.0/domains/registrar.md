# Registrar

[[toc]]

## Introduction

If you wish, you may purchase new domains directly in the Vapor UI. These domains are purchased using Amazon Route53's existing domain registration services, so all purchased domains will belong to your linked AWS account.

When a domain is purchased via Vapor, a DNS zone and wildcard certificate will automatically be created for the domain, allowing you to begin using the domain almost immediately.

:::tip Existing Domains

If you already own a domain via Route53 or another domain registrar, you may create a DNS zone for the domain using the "Add Domain" button within the Vapor UI's domain management screen. If a DNS zone for the domain already exists within Route53, Vapor will import the zone's existing records into Vapor.
